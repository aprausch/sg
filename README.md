# Description

This is a solution to Scientific Games' coding challenge. 
The challenge is stated as such:

    Description:
    Given a list of people with their birth and end years (all between 1900 and 2000),
    find the year with the most number of people alive.
    Code:
    Solve using a language of your choice and dataset of your own creation.


# STEP 1: Download
Download *rausch.html* and *script.js*. They must be contained in the same folder. 

# STEP 2: Enter Data
Open *script.js* in a text editor, and prepare to enter birth and death year data in the following format:

    Birth Year of Person 1, Birth Year of Person 2, Birth Year of Person 3, ... . 
    Death Year of Person 1, Death Year of Person 2, Death Year of Person 3, ... . 

   Edit the first two arrays in *script.js* to fit your data. 
   Here is an example:

    // SAMPLE DATABASE
  
        var birth = [1908, 1905, 1942, 1917, 1939, 1908, 1919, 1908, 1913, 1929, 1925, 1943, 1966];
        var death = [2000, 1982, 1970, 1963, 1963, 1973, 1998, 1992, 1994, 1968, 1965, 1971, 1997];
        
In this example, the first person in the database was born in 1908 and died in 2000.  The second was born in 1905 and died in 1982. ... The last person in the database was born in 1966 and died in 1997. 


There is no size length on the arrays, although they must have the same length. 

Save script.js once your data has been entered.  

# STEP 3: Run Program
Open rausch.html in a browser. The solution appears as a popup. (You may have to disable popups.)
