# Description

This is a solution to Scientific Games' coding challenge. 
The challenge is stated as such:

    Description:
    Given a list of people with their birth and end years (all between 1900 and 2000),
    find the year with the most number of people alive.
    Code:
    Solve using a language of your choice and dataset of your own creation.


# STEP 1: Download
Download the files in the repository. 

# STEP 2: Enter
Open script.js in a text editor, and prepare to enter birth and death year data in the following format:

    Birth Year of Person 1, Birth Year of Person 2, Birth Year of Person 3, ... . 
    Death Year of Person 1, Death Year of Person 2, Death Year of Person 3, ... . 

   Edit the first two arrays to accomodate your dataset.
   There is no limit on the number of entries. Here is an example:

    // SAMPLE DATABASE
  
        var birth = [1908, 1905, 1942, 1917, 1939, 1908, 1919, 1908, 1913, 1929, 1925, 1943, 1966];
        var death = [2000, 1982, 1970, 1963, 1963, 1973, 1998, 1992, 1994, 1968, 1965, 1971, 1997];
  
   Save script.js once your dataset has been entered.  

# STEP 3: Run
Open rausch.html in a browser. The solution appears as a popup. (You may have to disable popups.)
